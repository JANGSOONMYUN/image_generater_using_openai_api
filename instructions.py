## Output: Dall-E prompt
Create a vertically oriented tarot card with an aspect ratio of 1:1.73, featuring a central man and woman standing closely together, facing each other, and both holding golden Holy Grail-shaped cups. The figures are dressed in flowing robes with intricate patterns in harmonious and complementary colors. The man and woman are engaged in a toasting gesture, with their cups slightly touching and overflowing with sparkling water, symbolizing mutual respect and shared emotions. The background reveals a serene garden with a beautiful fountain at the center, a clear sky with subtle clouds, and a radiant sun, adding a sense of tranquility and warmth. Abundant flowers like roses and lilies, and two large lotus flowers in the water below, surround the garden, signifying love, passion, purity, and spiritual connection. Soft rolling hills, a tranquil river, and lush greenery create a landscape of peace and the flow of emotions. Two prominent golden Holy Grail-shaped cups are elaborately designed and filled with sparkling, overflowing liquid, symbolizing deep emotional bonds and spiritual connection. Above the cups, a caduceus symbol (two snakes entwined around a winged staff) signifies balance, partnership, and healing in the relationship.

The card design features a rectangular frame with gently rounded corners, ample padding at the top and bottom (approximately 20% of the overall height), and slightly less padding on the sides. The main scene is framed within an inner oval, focusing attention on the central figures and symbols. The border is ornately decorated with motifs of entwined vines, flowers, and flowing water, with elements of silver weaved through the designs to symbolize clarity, purity, and the reflective nature of emotional connections. The frame and central layout maintain left-right symmetry, evoking a sense of balance, harmony, and stability. The color palette includes soft pastel tones, gentle blues, greens, and golds, creating a harmonious and tranquil atmosphere. The card features a Roman numeral 'II' at the bottom, seamlessly integrated into the design for clarity. The overall vertical orientation and the longer vertical dimension follow traditional tarot card formats.
